working version of bookstore exercise, with line count of csv file implemented, however it only takes the csv file if it's from google drive with the extra nil line deleted, otherways if csv  from excell  it gives a nil error

most likely to do with formatting, of csv file, google docs saves using correct formatting of commans in between elements
while open office saves it spacing it with tabs.
